# QR Studio — Zalan Lykos

**Fancy, modern QR Code Generator** — built as my first public project in this series of small but useful tools.  
This is a **fully standalone HTML file** that you can drop on GitHub Pages (or anywhere) and it just works.

---

## 💡 What it does
- Generates QR codes instantly for **links or any text**.
- Lets you **customize size, colors, and format** (PNG or SVG).
- Works directly in the browser — **no installs**.
- **Download** or **copy the link** to your QR instantly.
- Polished, responsive, modern UI — looks great on desktop and mobile.

---

## 🛠️ How I built it
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla, no frameworks).
- Uses the free [goQR / QRServer API](https://goqr.me/api/) to generate the QR codes.  
  No need to host my own backend for this one — I just call their API and get the image back.
- Designed the layout with a **glassmorphic + gradient** style so it doesn’t look boring.
- Added my **personal stamp** at the bottom with my website link:  
  [`zalanlykos.github.io/web`](https://zalanlykos.github.io/web)

## 🚀 Why I made it
I wanted something quick but valuable to:
1. Practice **deploying on GitHub Pages**.
2. Experiment with **customizing an external API** for my own UI.
3. Have a simple, free, good-looking QR generator I can actually use.

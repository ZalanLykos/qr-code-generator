This is a **modern QR code generator** I made as one of my quick projects.  

---

## üí° What it does
- You type in a link or text ‚Üí pick size, colors, and format (PNG or SVG) ‚Üí get your QR instantly.  
- You can **download it**, **copy the link**, or **open it in a new tab**.  
- Looks clean with gradients, glass effect, and my personal stamp at the bottom:  
  *made by zalan lykos* + link to my main site ‚Üí [ZalanLykos](https://zalanlykos.github.io/web).

## üõ† How I built it
- **Vanilla HTML, CSS, JS** ‚Äî no frameworks.
- Uses the free [QRServer API](https://goqr.me/api/) for generating the QR code images.  
  (I‚Äôll do my own QR algorithm in another project, but this was about speed and polish.)
- Designed the UI so it doesn‚Äôt look like a 2005 QR tool.

## üöÄ Why I made it
- Wanted a quick project I could deploy to **GitHub Pages** and actually use.  
- Practiced integrating an external API into a static site.  
- Added customization features to make it better than the usual plain QR generators.

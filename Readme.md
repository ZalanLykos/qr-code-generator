This is a **modern QR code generator** I made as one of my quick projects.  

---

## 💡 What it does
- You type in a link or text → pick size, colors, and format (PNG or SVG) → get your QR instantly.  
- You can **download it**, **copy the link**, or **open it in a new tab**.  
- Looks clean with gradients, glass effect, and my personal stamp at the bottom:  
  *made by zalan lykos* + link to my main site → [ZalanLykos](https://zalanlykos.github.io/web).

## 🛠 How I built it
- **Vanilla HTML, CSS, JS** — no frameworks.
- Uses the free [QRServer API](https://goqr.me/api/) for generating the QR code images.  
  (I’ll do my own QR algorithm in another project, but this was about speed and polish.)
- Designed the UI so it doesn’t look like a 2005 QR tool.

---

## 🚀 Why I made it
- Wanted a quick project I could deploy to **GitHub Pages** and actually use.  
- Practiced integrating an external API into a static site.  
- Added customization features to make it better than the usual plain QR generators.
